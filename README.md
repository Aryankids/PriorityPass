## 🧭 Overview
This solution integrates **Priority Pass lounge access** with a **global taxi service**, creating a seamless airport journey experience for travellers.  
The system enables **intelligent journey planning**, **cross-platform inventory sharing**, and provides a **unified user experience** across mobile and web.

---

## 💡 Key Value Propositions

**👤 For Travellers:**  
A single interface manages the full airport journey, from taxi booking to lounge access.  
The system continuously calculates *Estimated Departure Time (EDT)* and provides real-time notifications, such as:
- 🚕 *“Your taxi will arrive in 10 minutes.”*  
- 🛫 *“Traffic is heavier than usual — consider leaving 20 minutes earlier.”*  
- 🛋️ *“Your lounge access opens at 3:00 PM.”*  

**🎟️ For Priority Pass:**  
Increased user engagement via travel services and opportunities for targeted advertising partnerships.

**🚖 For Taxi Partners:**  
Access to a high-value traveller segment with predictable demand, plus visibility into lounge booking inventory.

---

## 🎯 Scope
The **MVP** integrates one taxi partner.  
Future phases aim to include:
- Multi-partner arbitration  
- ML-driven EDT prediction  
- Integrated advertising
- Integrated BoardingPass

---

## 🧩 Assumptions
- A **web application** will replicate the full functionality of the mobile experience.  
- **Continuous EDT calculation** and correction are required.  
- The **development team agrees** with provided effort estimates (T-shirt sizing).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 🧩 High-Level Design Philosophy
The architecture follows five guiding principles:
1. **Microservices Architecture:** Services are loosely coupled, independently deployable, and focused on specific business capabilities
2. **Event-Driven Communication:** Asynchronous events enable real-time updates without tight coupling
3. **API-First Design:** All services expose REST APIs through a unified gateway
4. **Data Segregation:** PostgreSQL (transactional), Redis (cache), MongoDB (documents).  
5. **Platform Agnostic:** Services work for mobile, web, and partners.

### 🧰 Technical Stack Rationale
#### ⚙️ Backend Services

Our backend architecture uses a polyglot design — selecting the most suitable language and framework for each domain to optimize scalability, reliability, and developer productivity.

- 🟩 **Node.js / Express** — *Inventory & Notification Services*  
  **Why:** Fast I/O performance, excellent for API orchestration, and supported by a large ecosystem.  
  **Trade-off:** Less type safety than Java/C# (mitigated with TypeScript).

- 🐍 **Python / FastAPI** — *Journey Planning Service*  
  **Why:** Superior data science libraries for calculations, async support, and rapid development.  
  **Trade-off:** Different runtime from Node services (acceptable for a specialized service).

- ☕ **Java / Spring Boot** — *Booking Management Service*  
  **Why:** Strong transactional guarantees, mature payment integration libraries, and enterprise-grade reliability.  
  **Trade-off:** Heavier resource footprint (justified for critical booking logic).

---

#### 🗄️ Data Stores

- 🐘 **PostgreSQL:** ACID compliance for bookings, proven reliability, and excellent geospatial support.  
- 📦 **NoSQL:** Flexible schemas, high scalability, high performance, and the ability to handle diverse data types.  
- ⚡ **Redis:** Sub-millisecond response times for ETAs and flight data, with pub/sub capabilities.  
- 🔄 **Kafka:** Scalable event streaming, replay capabilities, and exactly-once semantics.

---

#### 📱 Mobile

- ⚛️ **React Native:** Single codebase for iOS and Android, fast iteration cycles, and access to a large talent pool.

#### 🧩 Summary Table

| Category | Technology | Purpose / Why | Trade-off |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| 🟩 **Backend** | **Node.js / Express** | Fast I/O, great for APIs, large ecosystem | Less type safety (mitigated with TypeScript) |
| 🐍 **Backend** | **Python / FastAPI** | Data science support, async, fast development | Different runtime from Node services |
| ☕ **Backend** | **Java / Spring Boot** | Strong transactions, mature libraries, enterprise-grade | Heavier resource footprint |
| 🐘 **Data Store** | **PostgreSQL** | Reliable, ACID-compliant, geospatial support | Heavier setup and management overhead |
| 📦 **Data Store** | **NoSQL** | Flexible schema, high scalability, high performance | Eventual consistency in some cases |
| ⚡ **Data Store** | **Redis** | Ultra-fast cache and pub/sub messaging | In-memory cost for large datasets |
| 🔄 **Data Store** | **Kafka** | Stream processing, replayable, scalable | Operational complexity |
| ⚛️ **Mobile** | **React Native** | Cross-platform, fast iteration, large talent pool | Occasional platform-specific limitations |

## 🧮 Core Components Deep Dive

### 🚀 Journey Planning Service
**Responsibilities**
- Compute optimal pickup times using live flight data.  
- Adjust dynamically for delays and traffic.  
- Manage time buffers (security, lounge, boarding).  

**Key Algorithm**
```
Pickup Time = Flight Departure 
             - Security Buffer (90 min)
             - Lounge Time (45 min if booked)
             - Current Travel Time (Maps API)
             - Dynamic Traffic Buffer (15–30%)
             - Contingency (15 min)
```

💡 *Suggestion:* Introduce adaptive ML buffer tuning post-MVP.

## 🔐 PCI Compliance Strategy
Achieved via **tokenization** and **scope reduction**.

| Step | Approach | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| No Card Data | Stripe-hosted forms | Tokenization |
| Network Segmentation | Isolated VPC | Restrict credentials |
| Encryption | TLS 1.3 + KMS | Key rotation |
| Audit Logging | Immutable (Splunk) | 1-year retention |
| Access Control | RBAC + MFA | Least privilege |
| Reduced Scope | Tokenization | SAQ-A compliance |

**Validation Activities**
- Annual PCI audit  
- Quarterly vulnerability scans  
- Pen tests pre-release  
- Staff security training
