# ✈️ Priority Pass & Taxi App Integration  
### *Seamless Airport Journey Architecture*

---

## 🧭 Overview
This solution integrates **Priority Pass lounge access** with a **global taxi service**, creating a seamless airport journey experience for travellers.  
The system enables **intelligent journey planning**, **cross-platform inventory sharing**, and provides a **unified user experience** across mobile and web.

---

### 💡 Key Value Propositions

**👤 For Travellers:**  
A single interface manages the full airport journey — from taxi booking to lounge access.  
The system continuously calculates *Estimated Departure Time (EDT)* and provides real-time notifications, such as:
- 🚕 *“Your taxi will arrive in 10 minutes.”*  
- 🛫 *“Traffic is heavier than usual — consider leaving 20 minutes earlier.”*  
- 🛋️ *“Your lounge access opens at 3:00 PM.”*

**🎟️ For Priority Pass:**  
Increased user engagement via travel services and opportunities for targeted advertising partnerships.

**🚖 For Taxi Partners:**  
Access to a high-value traveller segment with predictable demand, plus visibility into lounge booking inventory.

---

## 🎯 Scope
The **MVP** integrates one taxi partner.  
Future phases aim to include:
- Multi-partner arbitration  
- ML-driven EDT prediction  
- Shared inventory APIs  
- Integrated advertising  

---

## 🧩 Assumptions
- A **web application** will replicate the full functionality of the mobile experience.  
- **Continuous EDT calculation** and correction are required.  
- The **development team agrees** with provided effort estimates (T-shirt sizing).

### 🗺️ Context Diagram
Shows interactions between:
- Traveller
- Taxi App API
- Priority Pass Platform
- Payment Gateway
- Lounge Management System  

### 🧰 Container Diagram
Depicts high-level container relationships:
- API Gateway  
- Core microservices (Booking, Journey Planner, Inventory Sharing, etc.)  
- Databases and caches  

### 🔧 Component Diagram (Journey Planner)
Displays core logic flow:
- Flight data ingestion  
- Traffic API integration  
- ETA and buffer calculations  
- Caching tiers (in-memory, Redis)  

💡 *Suggestion:* Embed diagram images (e.g., `/docs/architecture-context.svg`) directly into the README.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 🧩 High-Level Design Philosophy
The architecture follows five core principles:

1. **Microservices Architecture:**  
   Each service is loosely coupled, independently deployable, and focused on a single business capability.

2. **Event-Driven Communication:**  
   Asynchronous events provide real-time updates across systems without tight coupling.

3. **API-First Design:**  
   All microservices expose REST APIs via a unified API Gateway.

4. **Data Segregation:**  
   - **Transactional:** PostgreSQL for bookings  
   - **Cache:** Redis for short-lived data  
   - **Document:** MongoDB for unstructured data  

5. **Platform Agnostic:**  
   Services remain neutral, accessible by any client (mobile, web, or partner).

💡 *Suggestion:* Assign service ownership explicitly to avoid domain overlap.

### 🧰 Technical Stack Rationale

#### Backend Services (Full Detail)
- **Node.js / Express (Inventory, Notification Services):**  
  Chosen for high I/O performance and robust API orchestration.  
  *Trade-off:* Less type safety than Java or C#, mitigated through TypeScript.

- **Python / FastAPI (Journey Planning Service):**  
  Ideal for real-time ETA and flight tracking logic due to rich data science libraries.  
  *Trade-off:* Different runtime environment from Node.js stack.

- **Java / Spring Boot (Booking Management Service):**  
  Ensures strong transactional guarantees and integrates with mature payment libraries.  
  *Trade-off:* Heavier memory footprint, justified for core booking processes.

#### Data Stores (Full Detail)
- **PostgreSQL:**  
  ACID-compliant database for transactional bookings, supporting geospatial queries.
- **NoSQL (MongoDB):**  
  Handles dynamic schemas and flexible document-based data.  
- **Redis:**  
  Sub-millisecond caching for ETAs, flight data, and pub/sub communication.  
- **Kafka:**  
  Serves as the event-driven backbone, ensuring scalability and message replay capabilities.

#### Mobile Stack (Full Detail)
- **React Native:**  
  Enables a single codebase across iOS and Android with fast iteration and large developer pool.

### 🧩 Technical Stack Summary Table

| Service | Tech Stack | Rationale | Trade-off |
|----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Inventory / Notifications | Node.js + Express | Fast I/O, orchestration | Less type safety |
| Journey Planning | Python + FastAPI | Async + data science support | Different runtime |
| Booking Management | Java + Spring Boot | Transactional integrity | Higher footprint |
| PostgreSQL | SQL | ACID, geospatial | Rigid schema |
| MongoDB | NoSQL | Flexibility | Eventual consistency |
| Redis | Cache | Speed | Volatile storage |
| Kafka | Event Bus | Scalability | Operational complexity |
