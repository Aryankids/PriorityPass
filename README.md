## 💡 Key Value Propositions

**👤 For Travellers:**  
A single interface manages the full airport journey, from taxi booking to lounge access.  
The system continuously calculates *Estimated Departure Time (EDT)* and provides real-time notifications, such as:
- 🚕 *“Your taxi will arrive in 10 minutes.”*  
- 🛫 *“Traffic is heavier than usual — consider leaving 20 minutes earlier.”*  
- 🛋️ *“Your lounge access opens at 3:00 PM.”*  

**🎟️ For Priority Pass:**  
Increased user engagement via travel services and opportunities for targeted advertising partnerships.

**🚖 For Taxi Partners:**  
Access to a high-value traveller segment with predictable demand, plus visibility into lounge booking inventory.

---

## 🎯 Scope
The **MVP** integrates one taxi partner.  
Future phases aim to include:
- Multi-partner arbitration  
- ML-driven EDT prediction  
- Integrated advertising
- Integrated BoardingPass

---

## 🧩 Assumptions
- A **web application** will replicate the full functionality of the mobile experience.  
- **Continuous EDT calculation** and correction are required.  
- The **development team agrees** with the provided effort estimates (T-shirt sizing).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 🧩 High-Level Design Philosophy
The architecture follows five guiding principles:
1. **Microservices Architecture:** Services are loosely coupled, independently deployable, and focused on specific business capabilities
2. **Event-Driven Communication:** Asynchronous events enable real-time updates without tight coupling
3. **API-First Design:** All services expose REST APIs through a unified gateway
4. **Data Segregation:** PostgreSQL (transactional), Redis (cache), MongoDB (documents).  
5. **Platform Agnostic:** Services work for mobile, web, and partners.

### 🧰 Technical Stack Rationale
#### ⚙️ Backend Services

Our backend architecture uses a polyglot design, selecting the most suitable language and framework for each domain to optimise scalability, reliability, and developer productivity.

- 🟩 **Node.js / Express** — *Inventory & Notification Services*  
  **Why:** Fast I/O performance, excellent for API orchestration, and supported by a large ecosystem.  
  **Trade-off:** Less type safety than Java/C# (mitigated with TypeScript).

- 🐍 **Python / FastAPI** — *Journey Planning Service*  
  **Why:** Superior data science libraries for calculations, async support, and rapid development.  
  **Trade-off:** Different runtime from Node services (acceptable for a specialised service).

- ☕ **Java / Spring Boot** — *Booking Management Service*  
  **Why:** Strong transactional guarantees, mature payment integration libraries, and enterprise-grade reliability.  
  **Trade-off:** Heavier resource footprint (justified for critical booking logic).

---

#### 🗄️ Data Stores

- 🐘 **PostgreSQL:** ACID compliance for bookings, proven reliability, and excellent geospatial support.  
- 📦 **NoSQL:** Flexible schemas, high scalability, high performance, and the ability to handle diverse data types.  
- ⚡ **Redis:** Sub-millisecond response times for ETAs and flight data, with pub/sub capabilities.  
- 🔄 **Kafka:** Scalable event streaming, replay capabilities, and exactly-once semantics.

---

#### 📱 Mobile

- ⚛️ **React Native:** Single codebase for iOS and Android, fast iteration cycles, and access to a large talent pool.

### 🧮 Core Components Deep Dive

#### 🚀 Journey Planning Service
**Responsibilities:**  
- Calculate optimal taxi pickup times based on flight schedules.  
- Provide real-time ETAs with traffic considerations.  
- Track flight status and adjust recommendations dynamically.  
- Manage time buffer calculations (check-in, security, lounge time).  

**Why It’s the Most Complex:**  
- Integrates multiple external APIs (flight data, maps/traffic).  
- Real-time calculations under performance constraints (< 1s response).  
- Handles complex edge cases (flight delays, traffic spikes, gate changes).  
- Caching strategy must balance freshness and performance.  
**Key Algorithm**
```
Pickup Time = Flight Departure 
             - Security Buffer (90 min)
             - Lounge Time (45 min if booked)
             - Current Travel Time (Maps API)
             - Dynamic Traffic Buffer (15–30%)
             - Contingency (15 min)
```
