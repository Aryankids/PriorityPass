## 🧭 Overview
This solution integrates **Priority Pass lounge access** with a **global taxi service**, creating a seamless airport journey experience for travellers.  
The system enables **intelligent journey planning**, **cross-platform inventory sharing**, and provides a **unified user experience** across mobile and web.

---

## 💡 Key Value Propositions

**👤 For Travellers:**  
A single interface manages the full airport journey — from taxi booking to lounge access.  
The system continuously calculates *Estimated Departure Time (EDT)* and provides real-time notifications, such as:
- 🚕 *“Your taxi will arrive in 10 minutes.”*  
- 🛫 *“Traffic is heavier than usual — consider leaving 20 minutes earlier.”*  
- 🛋️ *“Your lounge access opens at 3:00 PM.”*  

**🎟️ For Priority Pass:**  
Increased user engagement via travel services and opportunities for targeted advertising partnerships.

**🚖 For Taxi Partners:**  
Access to a high-value traveller segment with predictable demand, plus visibility into lounge booking inventory.

---

## 🎯 Scope
The **MVP** integrates one taxi partner.  
Future phases aim to include:
- Multi-partner arbitration  
- ML-driven EDT prediction  
- Shared inventory APIs  
- Integrated advertising  

---

## 🧩 Assumptions
- A **web application** will replicate the full functionality of the mobile experience.  
- **Continuous EDT calculation** and correction are required.  
- The **development team agrees** with provided effort estimates (T-shirt sizing).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 🧩 High-Level Design Philosophy
The architecture follows five guiding principles:
1. **Microservices Architecture:** Loosely coupled, domain-specific, independently deployable.  
2. **Event-Driven Communication:** Real-time updates via async events.  
3. **API-First Design:** REST APIs through a unified gateway.  
4. **Data Segregation:** PostgreSQL (transactional), Redis (cache), MongoDB (documents).  
5. **Platform Agnostic:** Services work for mobile, web, and partners.  

💡 *Suggestion:* Define ownership per service to reduce overlap.

### 🧰 Technical Stack Rationale
#### Backend
| Service | Tech Stack | Rationale | Trade-off |
|----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Inventory & Notifications | Node.js + Express | Fast I/O, orchestration | Less type safety |
| Journey Planning | Python + FastAPI | Data/ML-friendly, async | Mixed runtime |
| Booking Management | Java + Spring Boot | Strong transactions | Heavier footprint |

#### Data Layer
| Storage | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| PostgreSQL | Bookings, lounges | ACID, geospatial |
| MongoDB | Unstructured user data | Flexible schemas |
| Redis | Cache layer | Sub-ms latency |
| Kafka | Event streaming | Replay + scalability |

#### Mobile
- **React Native:** One codebase, faster iterations, large developer pool.  

💡 *Tip:* Maintain OpenAPI specs for API consistency.

## 🧮 Core Components Deep Dive

### 🚀 Journey Planning Service
**Responsibilities**
- Compute optimal pickup times using live flight data.  
- Adjust dynamically for delays and traffic.  
- Manage time buffers (security, lounge, boarding).  

**Key Algorithm**
```
Pickup Time = Flight Departure 
             - Security Buffer (90 min)
             - Lounge Time (45 min if booked)
             - Current Travel Time (Maps API)
             - Dynamic Traffic Buffer (15–30%)
             - Contingency (15 min)
```

💡 *Suggestion:* Introduce adaptive ML buffer tuning post-MVP.

## 🔐 PCI Compliance Strategy
Achieved via **tokenization** and **scope reduction**.

| Step | Approach | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| No Card Data | Stripe-hosted forms | Tokenization |
| Network Segmentation | Isolated VPC | Restrict credentials |
| Encryption | TLS 1.3 + KMS | Key rotation |
| Audit Logging | Immutable (Splunk) | 1-year retention |
| Access Control | RBAC + MFA | Least privilege |
| Reduced Scope | Tokenization | SAQ-A compliance |

**Validation Activities**
- Annual PCI audit  
- Quarterly vulnerability scans  
- Pen tests pre-release  
- Staff security training
